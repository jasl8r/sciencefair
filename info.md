#### <u>Participation</u>

* The Science Showcase is open to students in Grades K – 4 in the Groton Dunstable School District.  This includes the Florence Roche and Swallow Union Elementary schools.

* Participants will create a presentation that will be shared with judges and the public.  Participants are encouraged to be creative and have fun with the presentations.  There are fewer guidelines regarding the contents of the visual and oral presentation so participants should feel free to tailor the presentation to your own unique style.

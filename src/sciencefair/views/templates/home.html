        <h3>Students and Parents, Welcome to the Groton Dunstable Elementary Science Showcase!</h3>
        <p>
            <br/>
            The main goal of the Science Showcase is for participants to have fun while engaging in 
            a scientific process.  The 2016 Massachusetts Science and Technology Curriculum Framework 
            that is utilized by the Groton Dunstable Regional School District states "knowledge alone 
            is not enough: students need to be able to act on that knowledge. Students need to be 
            able to apply science and engineering practices-skills that let them analyze a natural 
            phenomenon or designed system and determine underlying mechanisms and causes-in civic, 
            college, and career contexts.<b>*</b> The Science Showcase allows participants to do just that!
        </p>

        <p>Additionally, students will have the opportunity to:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn specifics about a scientific subject through research.</li>
                <li>Perform a scientific project.</li>
                <li>Use their creative skills to explain their scientific project.</li>
                <li>Orally communicate their explanation to judges and the general public.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Changes to previous events:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>We are excited to introduce three awards for each grade level:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Best Oral Presentation</b></li>
                        <li><b>Most Original Project</b></li>
                        <li><b>Best Supporting Materials</b></li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Students are being given more flexibility to be creative in how they present their project.  Please review the "Guidance" section for all the exciting details.</li>
                <li>Students in grades 3 and 4 are now free to choose between the Informative Project and Experimental Project.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p/>

        <p>
            We welcome all elementary students from the Florence Roche and Swallow Union schools to prepare a Scientific
            Project and showcase their project at the Science Fair.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are excited to provide an arena for scholastic and creative abilities and to share the love of science.
            We hope that students will leave feeling proud of their accomplishments and learn about many scientific
            topics from each other.
        </p>

        <p>
            We look forward to seeing the many interesting projects that students will prepare.
            Good luck to all our participants and remember to have FUN!

# RULES and GUIDELINES
</center>

Yes, there are rules!  Since this is being organized by adults, obviously there has to be some rules.  <b>Please be sure to read <u>everything</u> below <u>carefully</u> before starting your project.</b>
<br>
<br>
#### <u>SAFETY RULES</u>

* Absolutely no materials or actions that can cause harm to people or damage to property are allowed!  This includes but is not limited to:  explosions, flame, dangerous chemical reactions, uncontrolled flying objects (UFOs), exposed sharp objects, hot objects that can burn, dangerous drugs, anything illegal or breaks district policy, and anything similar in nature to any of the above.  We hope you get the point and not get stuck by one!
* You must have an adult supervise the work you perform for your project.  Also, if there is any dangerous parts of your project (like electricity, heat, or sharp tools), have an adult perform those tasks.
* Be sure to use proper safety equipment (like safety goggles, gloves, etc.) and proper tools to work on your project.
* Be sure to follow the safety instructions that come with any materials or equipment that you use for your project.
* Do not eat or drink while working on your project and always wash your hands after working on your project.
* Be careful not to touch, taste, or inhale anything that can be dangerous to your health.
* Use proper safety precautions when using the internet.  Please have an adult supervise this activity carefully.
* Dispose of any waste products properly.

#### <u>PROJECT RULES</u>

* You may choose any scientific subject for your project.  It may be part of Life Sciences (animal, plant, human body, behaviors, etc.), Physical Sciences (matter, structure, sound, electricity, light, gravity, magnetism, forces, etc.) or Earth/Space Sciences (geology, weather, astronomy, etc.).
* You may work individually or with one partner.  Teams of more than two people are NOT allowed.   If you are working with a partner, you both must be in the same grade level and must contribute equally to the project including the oral and visual presentation.  This means each partner must give approximately half of the oral presentation three separate times to each of the three different judges.
* You must have an adult to supervise, coach, and guide you.  <b>However, they can not perform the work for you.</b>  This event is an opportunity for children to be part of the scientific process and feel proud of their accomplishments. Effort is one criteria that judges will use to score a project.  Projects where the majority of the effort was performed by the child should be rewarded appropriately.
* Grades K through 2 may do either of the two types of projects:  Informative or Experimental (see below for explanation of project types).
* Grades 3 and 4 must do an Experimental type of project (see below for explanation of project types).  You can not do an Informative type project.
* You must have at least two resources for your research.  These can be books, websites, magazines, expert people, etc.  Keep track of your resources.  You will need to list them on your display board (see below).

#### <u>VISUAL PRESENTATION RULES</u>

* See Appendix A for a diagram of the Display Board Layout.
* You must use a tri-fold display board as part of your visual presentation.  The display board must not be any larger than 36 inches high and 48 inches wide when fully open.  Each side panel width must be approximately equal to ¼ of the full open width.  You may purchase your tri-fold display board or make your own from cardboard.
* The width of table space each student will have is approximately 30 inches.  You will have the area in front of your display board for table space.  You may use the space under the table for storage.
* You must clearly display the title of your project, your name, your school, and your grade at the top/center of your display board.
* You must clearly display the resources you used for your project somewhere on your display board.
* For an Informative type project, you must have some pictures, models, or collections as part of your visual presentation (see below).
* For an Experimental type project, <b>you must perform your experiments at home;</b> not at the Science Fair as part of your presentation.  You may show your experiment by other visual methods (photos, graphs, videos, etc.).
* See below for items needed on your display board specific for the type of project you choose.

#### <u>ORAL PRESENTATION RULES</u>

* You may use any notation needed for your oral presentation.
* You may not have any parent or other person assist or coach you verbally while making your oral presentation.  You may have a parent or other person hold an object for you while you are making your oral presentation.
* Grades K through 2 are expected to give a 1 to 2 minute oral presentation.
* Grades 3 and 4 are expected to give a 2 to 3 minute oral presentation.
* See below for items needed during your oral presentation specific for the type of project you choose.

### PROJECT TYPES
</center>

These are the two types of projects that can be performed for the Science Fair.  Grades K - 2 may perform either of the two types of projects; Informative or Experimental.  Grades 3 and 4 must perform an Experimental type project only; not an Informative type project.

<br>
#### <u>INFORMATIVE PROJECT (not for Grades 3 and 4)</u>

This project is similar to a science report.  It involves researching a scientific topic, collecting information about it, and describing what you have discovered or learned.

Your oral and visual presentation should have the following parts:

* A scientific topic or question.  For example, “The Planets in the Solar System” or “What is the difference between a rock and a mineral?”
* Written information that explains or describes your topic or question.
* Pictures, models, or collections that complement your written descriptions or explanations about the topic or question.
* Conclusion(s) of what you have learned or discovered.

These items above should be clearly shown on your display board.  Also, don’t forget to display your resources.
<br>
<br>

<br>
#### <u>EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT (All Grades, K - 4)</u>

For this project, you will utilize the Scientific Method to learn cause and effect. The experiment will involve performing multiple tests, collecting data, presenting your results and making your conclusions.  The Scientific Method involves five steps:

1. Ask – Ask a question that you would like to find an answer to by doing research and testing.  Questions can begin like “What happens if…” or “Which one does…”
2. Research – Perform research on the scientific subject(s) involved with your question.  Read books, magazines, websites, etc. or talk to experts with knowledge in the subject.
3. Predict – After researching the subject, predict what will happen when you perform a test to find the answer to your question.
4. Test – Perform a test to find the answer to your question.  You will perform your test multiple times and collect the data.  Then show the results of the data you collected in a visual form using charts or graphs.
5. Conclude – After reviewing your test results, what can you conclude?  Did you predict correctly?  Why or why not?  Tell what all this means and why it is important.

Your oral and visual presentation should have the following parts:

* Title & Purpose – What’s the name of your project and what do you want to find out by performing the experiment.  State your question here.
* Resources – List the resources you used in doing your research.
* Hypothesis – This is the prediction that you are making based on your research.
* Test Set Up – What equipment and materials are you using to perform your test and what does it look like when testing?  Diagrams or photos with labels are a good way to show this.
* Test Procedure – What were the steps that you used to conduct the experiment?  Be very detailed.  Every time you perform your test, you must follow these steps exactly.
* Test Variables – What parts of the experiment were the same and which ones did you change?
* Test Data – Record the results of your test in a table.  You will have data for each of the multiple times you performed your test.
* Test Results – Take the data you collected in the table and show it in a graph(s) or chart(s).  Lines on your graph or bars on your chart may represent each of the multiple times you performed your test.
* Conclusion – What do the results tell you?  Was your hypothesis correct?  Why or why not?  What did you learn?  Explain how your experiment relates to the real world.

Be sure your display board has each of the items listed above on it.  You may also include any other pictures, charts, or drawings to make a nice visual presentation.
